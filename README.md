# GrillMasterBot
The Grill Master Robot is an innovative project aimed at automating the process of cooking a steak to perfection. Developed by Sam Peterson, Paul Owens, and Isaac Rademacher, this project utilizes a robotic arm to cook a steak with minimal human interference. The primary goal is to enable the robot to flip the steak at the right time, with additional goals including using a thermal camera for precise cooking and automating the entire process from placing to removing the steak from the grill.

## Running the code
The `serial.ino` file should be uploaded to the Arduino connected to the Robotic arm.  The serial connection should be adjusted in the `RoboticArm.py` depending on the hardware the code is running on.  The `main.py` file should be used to run the project.  Please reach out for a full report to understand teh correct configuration of the robotic arm for this code.
